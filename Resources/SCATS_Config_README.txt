Please find attached the .ini SCATS files that should correct the current “Australian intersection setup” problem we’re seeing in the SCATS intersection graphic for the SCATS corridors.

When SCATS client software is installed on a workstation, three folders are automatically created in C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\SCATS directory, where the "username" is your username. One of the folders generated is C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\SCATS\Access.  We need to check to see if these folders were created on your workstation. These three files need to be added to the Access folder in order for the graphics to display properly. See if you are able to manually create this folder on your workstation and install these files.

If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thank you.
